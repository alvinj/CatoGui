To-Do List
==========

* the path to the json "mappings" config file is hard-coded; get it from the command line.

* clean up CatoGui, which has grown unwieldly
* convert more templates
* ColumnData has more database types than i map; get them all in sync


* delete the old, dead code
* improve the gui. for instance, things are too tight on the properties panel
* still need to add a few more generated values to the `data` map?
* modify the 'generated code' dialog so its size varies depending on the size of the code generated

* does Freemarker support methods like 'capitalize'?
* work through @TODO items in the controllers
* get rid of `connectImageLabel`

* run from the command line


Long-term
---------

* pick up the user's jdbc jar file using reflection
* i should have written some of the tab enabled/disabled code using listeners
