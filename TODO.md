To-Do List
==========

* merge Play templates 3a and 3b?

* rename 1.0 to 0.1
* delete old, dead code
* ColumnData has more database types than i map; get them all in sync
* create About dialog
* test the Play code that's being generated
* add "singularize" method, similar to the way RoR works
* 	see https://github.com/philliphaines/inflector
* 	also https://github.com/backchatio/scala-inflector (didn't like this one)

* improve the gui. for instance, things are too tight on the properties panel
* still need to add a few more generated values to the `data` map?

* work through @TODO items in the controllers
* get rid of `connectImageLabel`
